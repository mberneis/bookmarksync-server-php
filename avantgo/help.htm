<p>
If you select the "Download Bookmarks" check-box you will be able to see all your links on your PDA.<br>
However, you should be aware that if you have a large collection of links, the download time will be long.<br>
Our recommendation is to leave this box unchecked and use only the "Add URL" functionality to add bookmarks on the go. 
</p>
<p>If you do decide to download your bookmarks you should also modify your SyncIT channel settings at the AvantGo website as follows:</p>
<li>Under "MY ACCOUNT," click on SyncIT (or click the "Edit" button and then click the SyncIT channel).</li>
<li>Increase Maximum Channel Size:  the channel size should be approximately the number of your bookmarks divided by 10 (i.e., if you have about 1000 bookmarks set it to 100K) </li>
<li>Increase Link Depth:  set to the maximum number of folder levels that you have in your bookmark tree (9 should be sufficient, but higher numbers are acceptable)</li>
<li>Include Images: we recommend YES</li>
<li>Follow Off-site links: NO</li>
