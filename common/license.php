     This legal document is an agreement between you,
     the end user (&quot;Licensee&quot;), and SyncIT.com Inc.
     (&quot;Licensor&quot;).
     BY DOWNLOADING OR OBTAINING AND USING THE
     REGISTERED VERSION OF SYNCIT.COM SOFTWARE, YOU
     ARE CONSENTING TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS
     AGREEMENT, WHICH INCLUDES THE SOFTWARE LICENSE
     AND SOFTWARE DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

     THIS AGREEMENT CONSTITUTES THE COMPLETE AGREEMENT
     BETWEEN YOU AND SYNCIT.COM. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE
     TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, CEASE TO USE THE
     PRODUCT IMMEDIATELY AND DESTROY ALL COPIES THAT
     YOU MADE.

     BOOKMARKSYNC SOFTWARE LICENSE
     -------------------------------------------------
     1. LIMITED WARRANTY: BookmarkSync is provided on
     an &quot;AS IS&quot; basis, without warranty of any kind,
     including without limitation the warranties of
     merchantability, fitness for a particular
     purpose, and non-infringement. Do not use it in
     any situation in which correct functioning is
     critical. The entire risk as to the results and
     performance of BookmarkSync is assumed by you,
     the Licensee. If BookmarkSync is defective, you,
     and not SyncIT.com or any distributor, agent or
     employee of SyncIT.com, assume the entire cost of
     all necessary servicing, repair or correction.
     SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSIONS OF AN
     IMPLIED WARRANTY, SO THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT
     APPLY TO YOU AND YOU MAY HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS
     THAT VARY BY JURISDICTION.

     -------------------------------------------------
     To the best of SyncIT.com's knowledge, your use
     of BookmarkSync in accordance with its
     documentation will not, in and of itself,
     infringe any third party's copyright, patent, or
     other intellectual property right. SyncIT.com is
     not liable or responsible in any way for any
     copyright violations you may commit as a result
     of using BookmarkSync.

     THE FOREGOING LIMITED WARRANTIES ARE IN LIEU OF
     ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR
     IMPLIED, AND SYNCIT.COM, DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL
     EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS,
     EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
     LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, OF
     NON-INFRINGEMENT, OF MERCHANTABILITY OR OF
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, regardless of
     whether we know or have reason to know of your
     particular needs. No oral or written information
     or advice given by SyncIT.com, its dealers,
     distributors, agents or employees shall create a
     warranty or in any way increase the scope of the
     above warranties, and you may not rely on any
     such information or advice. No action for breach
     of the above warranties may be commenced more
     than one (1) year following the expiration date
     of the warranty. If implied warranties may not
     be disclaimed under applicable law, then any
     implied warranties are limited in duration to 90
     days after delivery of this copy of BookmarkSync
     to you. Some states do not allow limitations on
     how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above
     limitation may not apply to you. This warranty
     gives you specific legal rights. You may have
     other rights, which vary from state to state.

     IN NO EVENT SHALL SYNCIT.COM, OR ANYONE ELSE WHO
     HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN THE CREATION, DISTRIBUTION,
     OR DELIVERY OF THIS PRODUCT SHALL BE LIABLE FOR
     ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
     PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL
     DAMAGES (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR
     LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION,
     LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, AND THE LIKE)
     ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE SUCH
     PRODUCT EVEN IF SYNCIT.COM HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
     THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. Because some
     states do not allow the exclusion or limitation
     of liability for consequential or incidental
     damages, the above limitation may not apply to
     you.

     2. TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS: This software,
     BookmarkSync, is licensed only to you, the

     held legally responsible for copyright
     infringement that is caused or encouraged by your

     (1) copy of BookmarkSync for backup purposes.
     You must reproduce and include the copyright

     BookmarkSync.

     6. LIMITED NONEXCLUSIVE LICENSE: This license is
     not a sale of the original software or of any
     copy. Title, ownership rights, and all

     the event of any litigation between you and

     prevailing party will be entitled to recover
     attorney's fees and expenses from the other
